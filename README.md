# Rebuilding Rails
It will be a Rails-like framework build using Ruby.

# But Why???????
I have been working on rails for quite sometime and sometimes I wonder how things work under the hood.
So, this is me trying to get my hands dirty and reinventing the wheel!

# WISH ME LUCK!!!
Also, since you are here and reading this crap. Why don't you listen to this song:

PS: I will try my best to document everything!!!

Also, I have been sublime text for a long time, but I pledge to use only and only vim for this project!!
Want to be a vim ninja!! B)
